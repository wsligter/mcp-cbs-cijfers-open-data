## Description
This rule ensures that all Go code follows idiomatic Go practices, adhering to the official Go style guide and common best practices in the Go community.

## Rule
When writing Go code:

### Naming Conventions
1. Use `camelCase` for variable and function names (not `snake_case`)
2. Use `PascalCase` for exported names (public functions, types, variables, constants)
3. Use `camelCase` for unexported names (private functions, types, variables, constants)
4. Use acronyms in all caps (e.g., `HTTP`, `URL`, `ID`) when they appear at the beginning of a name, otherwise all lowercase
5. Keep names short and descriptive; the larger the scope, the more descriptive the name should be

### Code Organization
1. Group related declarations (imports, constants, types, variables, functions)
2. Order imports in groups: standard library, third-party packages, local packages
3. Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code
4. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
5. Place methods on receiver types in a logical order, with the most important methods first

### Error Handling
1. Always check errors and handle them appropriately
2. Use the `errors` package for simple errors and `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for wrapping errors
3. Return errors rather than using panic (except for truly unrecoverable situations)
4. Use meaningful error messages that help diagnose the problem

### Comments and Documentation
1. Write comments as complete sentences with proper punctuation
2. Use godoc-style comments for exported functions, types, and variables
3. Focus on explaining "why" rather than "what" in comments
4. Document non-obvious behavior and edge cases

### Code Style
1. Use gofmt/goimports to format code
2. Avoid unnecessary else blocks after return statements
3. Prefer early returns to reduce nesting
4. Use named return values only when they improve readability
5. Limit line length to 100-120 characters
6. Use blank interfaces (`interface{}` or `any`) sparingly

### Concurrency
1. Use goroutines and channels appropriately
2. Always ensure goroutines can exit properly (avoid leaks)
3. Use context for cancellation and timeouts
4. Use sync primitives (Mutex, RWMutex, WaitGroup) correctly
5. Be careful with shared memory; prefer message passing when appropriate

### Testing
1. Write table-driven tests when testing multiple cases
2. Use meaningful test names that describe what is being tested
3. Structure tests as "Arrange-Act-Assert"
4. Use subtests for organizing related test cases
5. Avoid global state in tests

## Implementation
- The Cursor IDE will enforce this rule by:
  - Providing suggestions for idiomatic Go code
  - Highlighting non-idiomatic patterns
  - Offering refactoring options to improve code quality

## Benefits
- Consistent, readable code across the project
- Easier maintenance and collaboration
- Better performance and fewer bugs
- Code that follows community standards and best practices

## Examples

### ✅ Correct:

```go
// UserService provides user management functionality.
type UserService struct {
	repo Repository
	log  Logger
}

// FindByID returns a user by their ID or an error if not found.
func (s *UserService) FindByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
	user, err := s.repo.GetUser(ctx, id)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("finding user %s: %w", id, err)
	}
	return user, nil
}
```

### ❌ Incorrect:

```go
// bad naming, poor error handling, inconsistent formatting
type user_service struct {
	Repo Repository
	Log Logger
}

func (s *user_service) find_by_id(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
	user, err := s.Repo.GetUser(ctx, id)
	if err != nil { return nil, err }
	return user, nil
}
```
